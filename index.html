Yeah, I want more, more, more, more. (More, more, more, more) More, more, more, more. Little bit more (gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess) Ooh (oh me, oh my, I don't wanna hear no, no) Ooh (only want a yes, yes, oh me, oh my) Give me more (gimme just a little bit, little bit of) Ooh (oh me, oh my, gimme just a little bit more) Girls, I need it now (gimme just a little bit, little bit of)
